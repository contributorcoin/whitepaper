# Contributorcoin White Paper

This directory houses the [Contributorcoin White Paper](https://whitepaper.contributorcoin.com/en) and translations in different languages. A white paper translation uses the appropriate [ISO Language Code](https://www.w3schools.com/tags/ref_language_codes.asp) as the folder name and `lang` value in the gray matter. The `lang-ref` attribute should always match the English counterpart.

Anyone is welcome to contribute a translation!
